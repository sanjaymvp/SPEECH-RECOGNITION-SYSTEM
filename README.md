TASK DISCRIPTION:
The main task is to design a voice-controlled lighting system using Arduino, Bluetooth, and a relay. It includes connecting the HC-05 module to Arduino for wireless communication and programming the Arduino to control the relay based on received commands. The relay switches a 12V LED light ON or OFF as per user input. A mobile app with voice-to-text feature is used to send commands to the system. The setup enables wireless and hands-free control of lighting through simple voice commands.

WORKING PRINCIPLE:
The system operates by using an Arduino UNO microcontroller to interpret voice commands received via Bluetooth from a smartphone. The HC-05 Bluetooth module transmits text-based commands such as "ON" or "OFF" to the Arduino. The Arduino processes these commands and controls a 5V relay module accordingly. The relay acts as a switch to control the power supply to a 12V LED light. When the relay is activated or deactivated, the LED light turns ON or OFF based on the command.
